Suppose $f$ is analytic, defined on all of $\CC$, and for each $z_0 \in \CC$ there is at least one coefficient in the expansion $f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(z-z_0)^n$ is zero.
Prove that $f$ is a polynomial.

> Hint: use the fact that $c_n n! = f^{(n)}(z_0)$ and use a countability argument.


:::{.solution}
The claim is that there is some $N$ such that $\dd{^N f}{z^N} \equiv 0$, making $f$ a polynomial.
If no derivative is identically zero, the following set is countable:
\[
\Union_{n\in \NN} \dd{^n f}{z^n}\inv(0)
.\]
This is because each derivative is analytic and the zeros of an analytic function are countable.
But by hypothesis this set is uncountable.
