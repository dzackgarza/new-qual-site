  note: Statement compared with Hatcher, Algebraic Topology, Section 3.3, Exercise 21; it matches the printed text. The printed bracketed question about $X=\ZZ\times\RR$ was missing and is restored.

    Read the argument: excision identifies $H^n(X^+,U_K;G)$ with $H^n(X,X-K;G)$, cone-shaped
    neighbourhoods are cofinal, and on each of them the point $\infty$ is a homotopy equivalence,
    so the limit is $H^n(X^+,\infty;G)$.

    The print says "let $X^+$ be the one-point compactification" without hypotheses; that object is
    a compact Hausdorff compactification only when $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff, which the
    solution now states instead of using silently. The sets $U_K$ were also said to "range over all"
    neighbourhoods of $\infty$, which is false — they are cofinal, and the cofinality is now proved.
    DEFERRED, recorded not dropped: the printed bracketed question for $X=\ZZ\times\RR$ is not
    answered. Its hypothesis fails there, since the complement of a compact set meets infinitely many
    lines in unbounded intervals, and the card says only that; whether the isomorphism still holds is
    open on this card.

For a space $X$, let $X^+$ be the one-point compactification.
If the added point, denoted $\infty$, has a neighborhood in $X^+$ that is a cone with $\infty$ the cone point, show that the evident map $H_c^n(X; G) \to H^n(X^+, \infty; G)$ is an isomorphism for all $n$.
[Question: Does this result hold when $X = \ZZ \times \RR$?]

::: {.solution}
Two hypotheses are implicit in taking a one-point compactification of a general $X$: that $X$ is locally compact Hausdorff, so that $X^+$ is a compact Hausdorff space with $X$ open in it. Assume that below.

For a compact $K\subset X$, let $U_K=X^+\setminus K$, an open neighborhood of $\infty$. Excision of the point $\infty$, whose closure lies in the interior of $U_K$, gives
$$
H^n(X^+,U_K;G)\cong H^n(X,X\setminus K;G).
$$
As $K$ ranges over compact subsets of $X$, the neighborhoods $U_K$ are cofinal among the neighborhoods of $\infty$: every neighborhood $U$ of $\infty$ has compact complement $X\setminus U$, and $U_{X\setminus U}\subset U$. Hence
$$
H_c^n(X;G)\cong\varinjlim_{\infty\in U}H^n(X^+,U;G),
$$
the limit on the right being over all neighborhoods of $\infty$.

Inside the cone neighborhood from the hypothesis, every neighborhood of the cone point contains a smaller cone-shaped neighborhood that contracts to the cone point by radial scaling. These contractible neighborhoods are cofinal among the neighborhoods of $\infty$. For each such $U$, the inclusion $\{\infty\}\hookrightarrow U$ is a homotopy equivalence. The map of long exact sequences for the pairs $(X^+,U)$ and $(X^+,\{\infty\})$ therefore shows that restriction is an isomorphism
$$
H^n(X^+,U;G)\xrightarrow{\cong}H^n(X^+,\infty;G).
$$
These isomorphisms commute with restriction to smaller cone neighborhoods. Taking the direct limit gives the asserted isomorphism $H_c^n(X;G)\cong H^n(X^+,\infty;G)$.

The bracketed question is not answered here. For $X=\ZZ\times\RR$ the hypothesis fails already at the level of the local structure of $\infty$: the complement of a compact set meets infinitely many of the lines $\{n\}\times\RR$ in unbounded intervals, so no neighborhood of $\infty$ is a cone with cone point $\infty$. Whether the conclusion nevertheless holds is not settled in this card; what the computation above would need is that the class in $H^n(X^+,\infty;G)$ sees only finitely many lines, which is a $\varprojlim^1$ question over the compact exhaustion of $X$.
