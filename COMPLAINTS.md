# Mathematical issues and papercuts

Record issues encountered during source reading, solving, review, authoring or
site use under [QUAL-05](CONTRIBUTING.md#named-policies). Include findings outside
the selected card. This file owns observations; [TODO.md](TODO.md) owns selected
repair tasks and dependencies. Keep existing GitHub issue links rather than
copying their live status. The [review policy index](REVIEW_POLICY.md) supplies
named candidate patterns, not proof that a candidate is a defect.

## Recording an issue

Add a descriptive heading in the appropriate section below, with:

- **Object and need:** card/collection ID or affected workflow; the exact
  mathematical statement and hypotheses, or user action and expected behavior.
- **Observed evidence:** source page and passage, counterexample or proof gap,
  or actual action and result with the relevant path/revision.
- **Impact and owner:** affected parts or consumers, existing partial result,
  and the mathematical or tool boundary that must change.
- **Uncertainty:** distinguish a verified error from a source ambiguity or
  review candidate. State inspected scope and remaining questions. For absence
  claims supply Searched, Found, Conclusion, Confidence and Gaps.
- **Repair:** link the existing TODO task or issue when available and state
  the result that would resolve the observation.

A missing hypothesis with a concrete counterexample is a mathematical issue.
An unreadable source is an unresolved source question. An unsolved problem is
ordinary authoring work, not by itself a defect. A command that prevents reading
the intended card is a papercut even when it has a simple workaround.

Extend an existing entry when the same cause affects another card. Preserve
concurrent entries. If the selected proof requires a repair, link that dependency
and resolve it before relying on the statement; recording it does not make the
proof valid. Continue independent assigned mathematics.

After verifying the full repair, remove the resolved entry with evidence in the
fixing commit; retain any unresolved portion. Put durable mathematical errata
on the owning card and durable policy in CONTRIBUTING. Keep process notes out
of public mathematical remarks.

## Mathematical issues and source questions

### `E-GNYRR` turns the Cayley-Hamilton flag proof into a diagonalizable-only argument

- **Object and need:** `E-GNYRR` is meant to prove Cayley-Hamilton by an invariant flag for an upper-triangular matrix. The basis vectors need not be eigenvectors; the relevant scalars are the diagonal entries $\lambda_i$, for which $(A-\lambda_iI)\Fil_iV\subseteq\Fil_{i-1}V$.
- **Observed evidence:** The card says `supposing $v_i$ are eigenvectors for $\lambda_i$`. An eigenbasis makes $A$ diagonalizable, so the displayed argument no longer proves Cayley-Hamilton for a general operator. The final product is also indexed ambiguously as `\prod_i(A-\lambda_{n-i}I)`.
- **Impact and owner:** The selected proof, as posed, does not establish its claimed general conclusion. The owning file is `corpus/problems/Algebra/E-GNYRR.md`.
- **Uncertainty:** The intended repair is strongly determined by the preceding upper-triangular flag setup and by the standard triangular proof. The card has no external-provenance collection from which to recover exact source wording.
- **Repair:** Under TODO §7 / issue #2, replace the eigenbasis condition by an upper-triangularizing basis with diagonal entries $\lambda_i$, state the lowering relation explicitly, and complete the general proof by scalar extension to a splitting field/algebraic closure.


## Workflow and rendering papercuts

### Local repository connector and batched authoring query failures

- **Object and need:** Algebra solution authoring needs reliable local repository access and the existing authoring-query commands so a worker can inspect the shared state and derive an unsolved worklist without touching `queues/C-unsolved-cards.md`.
- **Observed evidence:** On 2026-09-09, the first local terminal call failed before execution with `Tunnel-client has not been seen for 300 seconds`. After switching to the second connected terminal endpoint, a read-only batched command combining collection discovery with several `just unsolved-in` queries was blocked by the execution safety layer before running, while the same collection-discovery command succeeded when retried alone. The first `just unsolved-in SRC-UCSD-ALG-FALL-2008` invocation also exceeded the 30-second foreground-yield window and had to be left running with redirected output for later inspection.
- **Impact and owner:** This does not change corpus mathematics, but it interrupts the repository-prescribed workflow of reading current state and selecting work through project tooling. The affected boundary is the local connector/execution environment rather than `qualc` semantics.
- **Uncertainty:** The connector failure is verified from the returned error. The safety block is verified for that specific batched shell command only; the exact classifier trigger is unknown. The long `unsolved-in` latency may be normal Pandoc startup/parsing cost rather than a repository defect.
- **Repair:** No existing TODO task owns the external connector/runtime. A resolving result would be stable local terminal availability, predictable execution of read-only project commands, and foreground authoring queries that either complete or expose a supported continuation mechanism instead of losing their result after the yield limit.
